# TipJar

This project has been made using NextJS. To try out the project for yourself clone the repository to your pc and run:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Or if you want to build and run the app, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
All the implemented features in the app work and everything is updated on a MongoDB database. While the payment system can be used it is highly recommended that anyone using that part of the project should change the payment system to use a more secure payment portal.

The app is deployed on the link mentioned in the description, so you can check it out there.
